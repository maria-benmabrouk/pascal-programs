# Pascal Programs

A collection of small **Pascal programs** created for **learning, practice, and academic exercises**.  
Each file is an independent program that focuses on a specific programming concept.

This repository is intended for students who are learning Pascal and want clear, simple examples.

## 📚 Topics Covered

- Basic input and output
- Conditional statements (`if`, `case`)
- Loops (`for`, `while`, `repeat`)
- Functions and procedures
- Number theory (prime, perfect, palindrome, binary operations)
- One-dimensional arrays
- Two-dimensional arrays and matrices
- Sorting and searching
- Practical mini-applications

---

## 🗂 Repository Structure

Each `.pas` file represents a standalone program.  
Programs are named according to the problem they solve.

---

## ▶️ How to Run the Programs

You can compile and run these programs using a Pascal compiler such as:

- **Free Pascal (FPC)**
- **Turbo Pascal**

> 📌 Note
>
> This repository contains a collection of old programs that I wrote during my early learning phase in programming.
>
> The code may include some minor mistakes or non-ideal practices, but it works and reflects my learning progress and understanding of programming concepts at that time.
>
> The purpose of this repository is to document my learning journey rather than to present polished, production-ready code.
